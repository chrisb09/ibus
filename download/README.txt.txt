Use start.bat or start.sh to start the program.
The default start script uses "TEST" as the password and locates the images in the "data" directory.
To change this edit the script.

Possible in-program commands for testing:

'encode source'
This will encode the entire folder source and its contents.

'decode source result'
This will decode the previously encoded source folder and place it inside the results directory.

If you stop a running encoding operation or the program encounters an error the data structure might be corrupted.

Please backup all your files before using this program.
